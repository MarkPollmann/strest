- Easily chain requests/responses to do complex workflows, ex. loging in, setting headers, performing a subsequent request.
- Presents you with detailed information on how your service is performing and other metrics you care about.
- Easily save and load workflows, no more messing with one time scripts.
- It runs on your local environment, no need to configure proxies/firewalls/vpns/whitelists, no tracking and no privacy concerns.

## Download
You can grab the latest version from the releases page or download it from strest.io.

## SaaS
You can easily develop/test your workflow locally and for many that is all you need every once in a while, however if you need more power/concurrency and/or you want to make stress testing part of your CI/CD then a paid SaaS Cloud service will be available in short.
